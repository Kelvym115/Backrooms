# Backrooms

This study project is an experiment that addresses the Backrooms. The project aims to bring a Backrooms experience as faithful as possible to its description.
Although the title of the project is 'Backrooms' the name of the game will actually be: 'Take the trash out!'. The player will take on the skin of a person who has 
just woken up in the afternoon and when going to the kitchen, he reads a message from his spouse that says: 'Take out the garbage!'.

When taking out the trash, the character is nocliped to the Backrooms, more precisely to the Level 0. Here the player will need to manage resources and survive as 
long as possible, in a maze of procedurally generated mono-yellow rooms.

**Features**:

- Fully interactive house with several freedom options;
- Backrooms with procedurally generated rooms;
- Hunger and thirst system (with collectible items);
- Mysteries and secrets to be discovered, as well as passages to other levels of the Backrooms;
